    "The features are of discrete type, often binary, with no missing values. The training data set is small and slightly unbalanced between the two classes we need to predict. So we can follow a path through the algoritms that sklearn suggests for this type of situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "the first algorithm I would try is the linear Support Vector Machine. The SVM can be a powerful classifier capable of dealing with situations when the classes are not linearly separable but as a first attempt to deal with this kind of data we should try a linearly separable boundary to see how it works. SVMs work well with high dimensional data. In terms of machine efficiency they are more expensive to train but use less memory than other algorithms. SVM are sensitive to scaling in the data, so we would have to standardize our training set to use them effectively since some features have significantly higher ranges than the others. They also suffer from imbalanced classes. \n",
    "SVMs are used for various tasks from image classification and text categorization to protein classification in biology. I'd give a first try at this algorithm and compare it to the next ones;\n",
    "\n",
    "the second algorithm that may be used is K Nearest Neighbors. This is an instance based algorithm that uses the whole data to make a prediction instead of building a parametric model (and then throw away the data). This algorithm is a good choice when the decision boundary is highly irregular and when the domain of application suggest a clear distance metric that may be used to cluster the data points. For example this algorithm can be very powerful on geolocated data. Any time we come up with a request to classify a sample based on a measure of \"similarity\" kNN can be the best choice. In our case we can look for students that have similar characteristics with respect to the student we want to classify. By finding the most similar N (hyperparameter) cases we can then apply some form of voting (weighted or not) to decide whether the student should be classified as passing or not. This algorithm is widely used for many classification tasks, from medical applications, document classification to recommender systems. A great advantage of kNN is that there is no training. This may be seem an advantage for our case study since one of the requirements is to keep resource usage low. On the other hand this algorithm can generally be much slower at prediction time. With fast changing data, this algorithm can keep up very well while other algorithms require continuous retraining, but one drawback of kNN is that it is affected by the curse of dimensionality problem. As the number of features grows we need exponentially more data to get good results. With a small sample like the one we have it is possible to use a brute force algorithm but as the data grows it becomes impossible;\n",
    "\n",
    "the third algorithm I selected is Decision Trees or better an ensemble method based on Decision Trees: Random Forest. Decision Trees have the advantage that they provide a easily understandable explanation of their behavior. If it was important to know which features were the most important for the classification task, for example to create an interactive user interface based on Q&A to the decision process, Decision Trees would be a good choice. \n",
    "Decision Trees create rectangular decision boundaries so the data must fit this hypothesis space for this algorithm to work well.\n",
    "The risk with Decision Trees in general is overfitting. We need to be able to prune the tree at the right place to avoid it. Another problem with decision trees is that our two classes are a bit imbalanced. The true class is twice more frequent than the false one. This may have a negative impact on the quality of the generated tree. One last caveat is that the number of features is big relative to the size of the training set. This means we have a dimensionality problem and the decision tree may find it difficult to select the correct features to create the tree.\n",
    "Random Forests are better performing in term of F1 score given the ensemble nature of the algorithm but present two drawbacks with respect to Decision Trees: they are more expensive in terms of training and prediction time and they do not provide the same explanatory capability.\n",
    "Decision Trees and relative ensembles are widely used in so many industries that making a list would take half of this answer. I found a reference here: http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",

In terms of processing cost kNN is going to increase its cost significantly as the data size grows while the other algorithms seem quite stable at prediction and RF is also quite constant in training time. With such a small dataset processing time differences are not relevant, so we should ask for a prediction on real world dataset sizes and their expected growth rate to decide wether this aspect should affect our choice of algorithm.\n",
    "I want to point out that the measured score of the three algorithms is not so different and making a choice based on untuned results is a bit arbitrary. In reality I think we should make a choice after some tuning attempts on all three models. We see that RF tends to overfit in our untuned test and has a consistently high training F1 score. Maybe with some tuning it can do relatively better than the others. Actually, I tuned all three algorithms and saw that kNN and LinearSVC improve much less than RF and in the end RF has the best result. In conclusion, I'm going to choose the Random Forest which also is the most stable in terms of processing time. Maybe this is cheating, but if I had decided based on the test F1 performance of the untuned models I would have chosen the wrong model and probably also the slowest."

Basically, the Decision Tree algorithm tries to find the feature on which we can split our data so that we have most \"passed\" cases on one split and most \"not passed\" cases on the other. The feature that generates the best separation of our data is chosen first to create the root node of the tree.\n",
    "The splitting process is repeated on the obtained two splits using the remaining features in the same fashion to iteratively make new splits. This results in the creation a tree where the nodes can be interpreted as questions we can ask about a new sample we need to classify and the edges are the possibile answers to these questions. This allow us to navigate  the tree until we find a leaf node that gives us the requested classification.\n",
    "Building such a tree is a non deterministic procedure (in particular when the number of features is large). This means I will probably get a different tree every time I will run it. In order to mitigate the effects of random tree construction, the Random Forest algorithm creates many of these trees and chooses an answer by having each member tree express a vote (remark: this is not the way sklearn does it but seems easier to understand in layman terms) and choosing the final answer by majority."
