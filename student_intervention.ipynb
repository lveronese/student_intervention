    "As a first algorithm I would try Decision Trees or ensemble methods based on Decision Trees like Random Forest. Decision Trees have the advantage that they provide a easily understandable explanation of their behavior. If it was important to know which features were the most important for the classification task, for example to create an interactive user interface based on Q&A to the decision process, Decision Trees would be a good choice. Random Forest are better performing in term of F1 score given the ensemble nature of the algorithm but present two drawbacks with respect to Decision Trees: they are more expensive in terms of training and prediction time and they do not provide the same explanatory capability.\n",
    "Decision Trees create rectangular decision boundaries so the data must fit this hypothesis space for this algorithm to work well.\n",
    "The risk with Decision Trees in general is overfitting. We need to be able to prune the tree at the right place to avoid it. Another problem with decision trees is that our two classes are a bit imbalanced. The true class is twice more frequent than the false one. This may have a negative impact on the quality of the generated tree. One last caveat is that the number of features is big relative to the size of the training set. This means we have a dimensionality problem and the decision tree may find it difficult to select the correct features to create the tree.\n",
    "Decision Trees and relative ensembles are widely used in so many industries that making a list would take half of this answer. I found a reference here: http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Another algorithm that I would try on this data is Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a simple, fast algorithm that often performs surprisingly well. Since the variable to predict is binary, we also avoid to resort to the one-vs-rest approach. Logistic Regression is a widely used algorithm in applications ranging from marketing to medical research, to give two notable examples. Logistic Regression works well when the classes are linearly separable. If this is not the case this algorithm tends to perform badly. if the data supports it this may be our best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a third algorithm I would try a Support Vector Machine. The SVM can be a powerful classifier capable of dealing with situations when the classes are not linearly separable. They work well with high dimensional data. In terms of machine efficiency they are more expensive to train but use less memory than other algorithms. SVM are sensitive to scaling in the data, so we would have to standardize our training set to use them effectively since some features have significantly higher ranges than the others. They also suffer from imbalanced classes. \n",
    "SVMs are used for various tasks from image classification and text categorization to protein classification in biology. I'm evaluating this algorithm as an alternative to LR in case the data shows a marked non linear decision boundary (if LR is underperforming we may conclude that there is not linear separation thus we may try a SVM).\n"

This process is repeated on the splits using other features to make new splits thus creating a tree where the nodes are questions and the answers to these questions allow us to navigate through the tree until we find a leaf that gives us the requested answer. \n",

    "The training score after tuning is 0.9095 while the test score is 0.7801. Due to randomness in the construction if we repeat the tuning procedure we get different results so I used the same random state used in the model selection phase. I tried various values for min_samples_split. I played with a lot of combinations using various parameters like min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_features and n_estimators and got no better answer than the default one which is the one I would clearly keep.\n",
    "What is relevant from this is that tuning did not improve the model. I tried to reason about this behavior which seems odd at first. Why we didn't get our original untuned model as the best one and instead we got a worse one? One possibile explanation I came with is that we have a rather small training set and GridSearchCV does folding, so it has to use an even smaller training set to test the various parameter combinations. With such a small training set maybe this procedure is not so effective and is not capable of finding the best hyperparameters combination. But I'm guessing. I may have done something bad.\n",

    "In the end I would prefer the RandomForestClassifier if the expectation is to have more data available in the future to train the model. We see from the learning curves that are implicit in the data we collected that as the training set size grows the RF algoritm improves a bit faster than LR and the training score of RF is better than LR. Since the training score is the upper limit for the test score, RF seems to have more room for improvement.\n",
    "The absolute runtime performance of the two models is not so different with this data set. We are talking about timing deltas in the order of milliseconds. So I would actually use the RF on this data and schedule a second run of comparison between RF and LR when significantly more data is made available."
