    "As a first algorithm I would try Decision Trees or ensemble methods based on Decision Trees like Random Forest. Decision Trees have the advantage that they provide a easily understandable explanation of their behavior. If it was important to know which features were the most important for the classification task, for example to create an interactive user interface based on Q&A to the decision process, Decision Trees would be a good choice. Random Forest are better performing in term of F1 score given the ensemble nature of the algorithm but present two drawbacks with respect to Decision Trees: they are more expensive in terms of training and prediction time and they do not provide the same explanatory capability.\n",
    "Decision Trees create rectangular decision boundaries so the data must fit this hypothesis space for this algorithm to work well.\n",
    "The risk with Decision Trees in general is overfitting. We need to be able to prune the tree at the right place to avoid it. Another problem with decision trees is that our two classes are a bit imbalanced. The true class is twice more frequent than the false one. This may have a negative impact on the quality of the generated tree. One last caveat is that the number of features is big relative to the size of the training set. This means we have a dimensionality problem and the decision tree may find it difficult to select the correct features to create the tree.\n",
    "Decision Trees and relative ensembles are widely used in so many industries that making a list would take half of this answer. I found a reference here: http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Another algorithm that I would try on this data is Logistic Regression. Logistic Regression is a simple, fast algorithm that often performs surprisingly well. Since the variable to predict is binary, we also avoid to resort to the one-vs-rest approach. Logistic Regression is a widely used algorithm in applications ranging from marketing to medical research, to give two notable examples. Logistic Regression works well when the classes are linearly separable. If this is not the case this algorithm tends to perform badly. if the data supports it this may be our best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a third algorithm I would try a Support Vector Machine. The SVM can be a powerful classifier capable of dealing with situations when the classes are not linearly separable. They work well with high dimensional data. In terms of machine efficiency they are more expensive to train but use less memory than other algorithms. SVM are sensitive to scaling in the data, so we would have to standardize our training set to use them effectively since some features have significantly higher ranges than the others. They also suffer from imbalanced classes. \n",
    "SVMs are used for various tasks from image classification and text categorization to protein classification in biology. I'm evaluating this algorithm as an alternative to LR in case the data shows a marked non linear decision boundary (if LR is underperforming we may conclude that there is not linear separation thus we may try a SVM).\n"

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

Indeed, the absolute numbers are not practically relevant (with this amount of data) and training time remained constant for RF from 100 to 300 samples. It seems to me that the Random Forest could improve significantly with more data and adequate tuning while LR seems more difficult to improve.\n",

Basically, the Decision Tree algorithm tries to find the most important feature on which we can split our data so that we have most \"passed\" cases on one split and most \"not passed\" cases on the other. This process is repeated on the splits using other features to make new splits thus creating a tree where the nodes are questions and the answers to these questions allow us to navigate through the tree until we find a leaf that gives us the requested answer. \n",
